                Way back in 1943, Carl Roettele had an idea—marry the richness of fresh tomatoes to the zestiness of green chili peppers. The result was legendary and the rest is history.  RO*TEL still holds firmly to the belief that quality is paramount in making a great tasting product. That's why only the reddest, ripest tomatoes and the zestiest chilies make the final cut.

                In early summer of 1965, a University of Florida assistant coach sat down with a team of university physicians and asked them to determine why so many of his players were being affected by heat and heat related illnesses. The researchers — Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada — soon discovered two key factors that were causing the Gator players to ‘wilt’: the fluids and electrolytes the players lost through sweat were not being replaced, and the large amounts of carbohydrates the players’ bodies used for energy were not being replenished. The researchers then took their findings into the lab, and scientifically formulated a new, precisely balanced carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that would adequately replace the key components lost by Gator players through sweating and exercise. They called their concoction ‘Gatorade’.

From there, fruit flavors joined the mix with the introduction of Ice Breakers Sours in 2005, and Sours Gum in 2007. Since then, Ice Cubes Gum and Ice Breakers Duo have also entered the Ice Breakers lineup. Today, each of its great-tasting mints and gum delivers dazzling tastes and a mouth-freshening lift.

        			Introduced back in 1989, Annie’s Shells & White Cheddar is our original and best selling product. Annie created Shells & Cheddar (as we call it here) in her kitchen when she realized there was no all-natural, white cheddar macaroni & cheese on the market. She came up with a totally delicious product that is made with real white cheddar cheese and organic shell shaped pasta.

        			Annie's Homegrown is a good company with good people that makes good food and does good stuff. From the beginning, Annie impressed upon us the necessity of operating responsibly by giving back to the community. Because if you don't take care of the folks who are taking care of you, everything gets ugly. And anyone who thinks an ugly planet is a healthy planet is a wackadoo. Annie's motto: Eat Responsibly. Act Responsibly.  Annie's Homegrown has stayed committed to its goals even as the company has expanded. With distribution in all 50 states, it's become the second-largest brand of macaroni and cheese in the U.S. And in their own words: "We know we're the first most delicious."  History of Annie's Homegrown  After creating Smartfood in 1982, one of the fastest-selling snack food products in U.S. history, Annie Withey co-founded Annie's Homegrown in 1989 with the idea of making a great-tasting, all-natural macaroni and cheese. In the end, though, she did a lot more than that.  In 1998, Annie's Homegrown was the first to develop and introduce three amazing kinds of organic macaroni and cheese. At the end of 2001, Annie's introduced a line of certified organic pasta, dressed up in a lovely bright purple box. And in 2005, Annie's introduced three flavors of Deluxe Mac and Cheese, four awesome flavors of organic crackers that they call Cheddar Bunnies, and three flavors of graham crackers called Bunny Grahams, made with organic ingredients.  Annie continues to be the inspirational leader of Annie's. She works from her home in Connecticut, answering some consumer letters and providing input on new product and marketing ideas. She remains the company's corporate conscience.

        			Although uncommon in American cooking, the citrus floral taste of lavender is characteristic of French provincial cooking. Add the delicious taste of lavender in sauces, dressings and desserts with Faerie's natural lavender flavor extract. All great cooking starts with the same thing, great ingredients. Our premium quality extracts and liquid flavors give you an extra degree of flavor in all your cooking and baking. They are specially formulated to withstand the high heat of baking and still bring you maximum flavor.

                While a staple of the healthy Mediterranean diet, the tomatoes arrived in Europe in the 1500's from South America. There, the precursor to today's tomato was first cultivated in what is now Mexico most likely by the ancient Aztecs as far back as 500 BCE. Cherry tomatoes are closer to the original smaller tomatoes of the Aztec than today's larger European varieties. The tomato fruit spread with the Spanish Empire and was incorporated into the European and global cuisine in the late 17th century. Sun-dried tomatoes were originally developed so that they can be used during winter months when fresh tomatoes were not available. 

Lycopene is a form of antioxidant present in tomatoes. An excellent source of vitamins C and A as well as vitamin K important in bone health.

                To rehydrate, place the tomatoes in boiling water for two to four minutes. Alternatively, soak in cold water for two hours. These small, delicious tomatoes may be used directly in salads, sauce, as seasoning and in stews. Store in a cool and dry place, do not refrigerate.

                Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whisky Cake is made from a simple recipe that uses the finest available ingredients. There are no artifical preservatives or additives. The taste of fresh creamery butter evokes the memory of old-fashioned shortbread. The smooth, mellow, and golden Irish whisky leaves no doubt of Ireland's profound influence on this rich, dense, and moist cake.

        			Cinnamon flavored Spry xylitol gum is a natural alternative to artificially-sweetened bad breath gum and other dry mouth products. It is comprised of seven sustainable, non-GMO ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural Cinnamon Flavor, Vegetable Glycerin, Gum Arabic, Soy Lecithin, and Beeswax. All gluten-free ingredients are handled with precision and care to ensure the absence of cross contamination of potential allergens. The leading ingredient, xylitol, is recommended by dental and medical professionals for its positive effects on oral and bodily health. Spry’s natural chewing gum will stifle bad breath and help the symptoms of dry mouth, yet those benefits are merely the beginning. By chewing aspartame free gum daily, you’ll protect your teeth from bacteria and acid buildup which can lead to tooth decay, cavities, and other serious dental problems. This is because xylitol works as a shield—inhibiting bacteria's ability to stick to your teeth and further taking over the mouth. Spry recommends its natural xylitol gum line in conjunction with its other xylitol products, such as Spry Xylitol Mints or SparX Xylitol Candy, at least five times throughout the day. By chewing xylitol gum immediately after meals and snacks, your mouth is constantly exposed to xylitol thus maximizing its benefits and your oral health. Spry isn’t simply a refreshing gum for dry mouth sufferers, bad breath, and promoting clean teeth. Because it is 100% sugar-free and has less than two calories per piece, Cinnamon Spry xylitol gum is a healthy addition to your diet, helping you avoid the mental and physical effects that sugar-laden products bring. In fact, while xylitol looks and tastes like sugar, it’s actually a sugar alcohol found naturally in fruits, vegetables—even the human body. You won't regret it!

B00562WN1Q , 2 oz jar Aleppo pepper > has perfectly balanced heat and amazing flavor, sweet and rich and almost smoky. This Turkish crushed chili has an ancho-like flavor with a little more heat and tartness. It's chunkier than paprika, so the flavor pops more. Use it in the oil for roasted potatoes, on baked winter squash, in the batter for corn bread or dough for cheese wafers, in the dry rub for cured duck legs; as a substitute for cayenne or hot red pepper flakes.

        			This Villa Manodori Balsamic Vinegar is lovingly crafted by Chef Massimo Bottura of Modena Italy. Made in limited quantities from locally grown trebbiano grapes, it is aged a minimum of 10 to 15 years before it is sold. It pairs perfectly with greens, grilled meats and vegetables as well as with aged cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano. It also makes a wonderful glaze for steak, poultry and pork. 8.5 fl. oz.

B000TVG3NI , Tone's Cayenne Pepper has 28,000-40,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Use sparingly, as this product is very hot. Be sure to use care when cooking with this product, as it will burn if it gets in eyes or cuts. Start by using just a dash per serving, and adjust from there. 16oz (1lb) shaker.

SERVING SUGGESTIONS
Add anywhere that heat is desired. Cayenne pepper is good in most Mexican and Cajun dishes. Add to dips, nachos, guacamole, blackened fish or meats, pastas, barbecue sauces, buffalo wings, stir-fry dishes and tomato-based foods. Adds a hot flair of flavor to French fries and popcorn. For optimum quality, store in freezer or refrigerator.

B0000D9N7U , Fondue is a traditional Alpine specialty, blending the distinct flavors of three classic melting cheeses: Emmentaler (15.5 oz), Gruyere (7.5 oz), and Appenzeller (7.5 oz). White wine, Kirsch brandy and certain spices can then be added to taste, creating a delicious hot meal. With its bold flavor and creamy texture, fondue is perfect for a main meal or as an appetizer, and is always a hit when the weather turns cold. This set of gourmet cheeses includes the correct ratios to make a classic cheese fondue (see included recipe sheet).

B0050IKPMA , Wild Boar salami is a mixture of field harvested Texas wild boar and all natural pork belly, seasoned with cloves and juniper berries for a robust yet sweet flavor. Creminelli’s Wild Boar Salami was selected as a finalist for Outstanding Meat in 2010 and has been featured in national meeting such as Wine Spectator, the San Francisco Chronicle and Tasting Table. Wild boar meat is leaner, tangier, and deeper in color making a more exotic product. The flavor profile is stronger and more distinctive and takes on the tones of the boar’s wild diet which includes roots, grasses, nuts, and berries. Creminelli’s wild boar salami pairs well with fresh figs, dates, walnuts, pistachios, rosemary bread, fried polenta, potatoes and spinach boiled and butter-fried, and Pecorino Toscano, Toma & Brá cheese. Wild Boar is stuffed into a straight natural casing, hand-tied and then slowly cured.

        			The secret lives of plants have captured the imagination and respect of Traditional Medicinals for more than 30 years. Blending a reverence of plants with the wisdom of the ancient arts, Traditional Medicinals combine the best of herbal medicine with the most modern scientific methods of quality control to produce a line of traditional herbal tea formulas distributed across the country. It all started in early 1974, when three young friends started Traditional Medicinals in the back store room of a small herb shop along the Russian River in Northern California. The company was founded with the intention of providing healing remedies, while preserving the knowledge and herbal formulas of Traditional Herbal Medicine, or THM. At the time, traditional herbal tea infusions, likely the earliest form of medicine, had all but faded away here in this country. And never before had these safe and effective medicines been available in convenient tea bags. Over the decades that followed, the company introduced millions of health conscious consumers to traditional herbal tea formulas and the concepts of THM. These effective natural medicines were well received and Traditional Medicinals has grown dramatically. Well over a billion cups of tea have been produced at the company's California facility, and many products such as Smooth Move, Throat Coat, and Organic Echinacea Plus have become mainstream and can readily be found throughout North America.

Buy Lentils grown from the fertile soil of Washington State. The Mader family has been involved in agriculture for five generations. Our farm operations span across the south east part of Washington State and are headquartered in Pullman, WA. In 2001 we acted on an opportunity to add a grain and legume cleaning facility to our operation. Our Cleaning Facility, Palouse Trading is located in Palouse, WA - just a short drive from Pullman. Palouse Trading was originally named Wallace Grain and Pea when it first opened its doors in the 1930's. The plant was designed for quality not quantity and has cleaned legumes and grains for the international market and domestic consumption. Our food is appealing to our consumers because of its nutrition, aesthetics and traceability to our farm. Each bag of food comes with a QR Code that allows you to see harvest details of your food, seeding dates, the field we grew it in, and more. All of our products are certified Kosher Parve, Non-GMO Project Certified and our farming methods are Certified Sustainable by the Food Alliance. Our foods are different because Steve & Kevin Mader plant, harvest, clean and package at our own facilities in Washington State - there are few if any companies that can track your food and details of your food back to the field like we do.

We grow Spanish or Pardina lentils, it is very rare to find this variety of lentils in grocery stores in North America. It is a tiny lentil with blue/purple undertones to the brown skin and a yellow inside. This is the lentil of choice in the Mediterranean and Spain. They have a strong nutty flavor and they hold their shape very well after being cooked. This combination makes them desirable for all types of lentil recipes. The lentils are fabulous for cooking, baking and lentil soup. Their nutty flavor lends itself expertly to baked goods. These brown lentils also make the best meat substitute as they are one of the only lentils that hold their shape when cooked, from lentil tacos to lentil loaf, these lentils never disappoint.

B003D0SPC4 , These are the ultimate pimiento stuffed olives, and a hands down favorite within the La Tienda community! The sweet and smoky flavor of the piquillo pepper lifts the olive to another level of flavor. Because this is a premium product, the olives are stuffed with a whole piece of pimiento pepper. Each of these olives from Sevilla has an actual slice of fire roasted piquillo pepper harvested from the famous Lodosa region next to the vineyards of La Rioja in Northern Spain. This is quite different from the hum drum pimento stuffed olives which have blanketed America for decades. In those, the producer grinds up scraps of peppers into a paste, and mechanically squirts some of the paste into the pitted olives. Once you and your guests have tried these Piquillo stuffed olives, you will be spoiled! They will be the only ones which truly satisfy your palate. ------------ El no va mas en aceitunas rellenas de pimientos! Cada aceituna está rellena con un trozo entero de pimiento del piquillo asado al fuego de la famosa ciudad pimentera de Lodosa en la región de Navarra en el Norte de España. Dulce y ahumado, el pimiento de piquillo eleva la aceituna a otro nivel de sabor. Un favorito de La Tienda

        			Fennel is a member of the Apiaceae family, in the genus Foeniculum. It is an aromatic, hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. Fennel was used for medicine and a flavoring agent in ancient China, Egypt, Greece and India. The Romans used fennel during fasts to overcome hunger. Fennel was also used to combat diseases in ancient times. Pliny, an ancient Greek historian, believed that fennel improved eyesight; consequently, fennel tea and eyewash was used to soote strained eyes, improve eyesight, and treat cataracts.

        			Founded in 1972, Stash Tea Company originally operated out of an old Portland Victorian style house, supplying loose herbal teas and bulk herbs to natural food stores. Starting in 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and then began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail order catalog to consumers. Today, Stash Tea Company is one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States. The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship’s captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his “stash,” stowed carefully as his “private reserve.” Today, the term is still used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness.

        			Just the Cheese is made by Specialty Cheese Company, Inc., which owns and operates four of the oldest and smallest cheese plants in the United States. More than 60 small family farmers supply Specialty Cheese Company with their milk every day. Their 110 employees, led by ten Wisconsin licensed cheesemakers, make more than 35 varieties of cheese representing dozens of ethnic traditions. "Over the years, our cheesemakers have demonstrated their talents by producing 'grand champion cheeses' of many varieties. In fact, our skilled cheesemakers have trophies that cover the range of traditional cheeses plus our newer, more distinctive varieties." "The facts about our company's history are a bit obscured due to the lack of records, we do know that our oldest factory, the Leader plant, has been continuously making cheese for at least 150 years. You see, the earliest real estate deed we can find for the property simply says that when the factory was sold to our predecessors in 1839 it was being used as a 'cheese factory.' That makes the plant the oldest functioning cheese plant in Wisconsin! Our other two plants are comparatively new--they merely date back to the turn of the century." At that time, there were more than 4,000 cheese factories in Wisconsin. Today there are fewer than 150. The company's four plants are among the few that have survived the pressures of change. "We have done so by investing in plant improvements (the Leader plant, for instance, is now one of the smallest USDA approved plants in the country) and changing the types of cheese we produce," they say. "By applying our cheesemakers' skills to producing new varieties of cheese and constantly seeking to improve our product quality, we have been able to increase our plants' production and double their employment in the past five years." "We are proud to continue Wisconsin's tradition of producing the finest cheese to the most exacting standards. We plan to do so with more cheesemaking innovations through the 21st century!"

                Tresomega Nutrition's Organic Quinoa Pasta are a gluten-free and high protein alternative to traditional pasta.  With a texture similar to whole-wehat pasta, you can easily use it in your favorite cold pasta salad recipe or for a more nutritional spin on macaroni and cheese.   Quinoa is a good source of magnesium, riboflavin, and is the only plant based protein that contains all 9 essential amino acids.  Quinoa is being called a resistant starch food - a type of carbohydrate that resists digestion in the small intestine, giving you a feeling of fullness, raises metabolism, and controls blood sugar and cravings.

                In the 1930’s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling fresh, non-pasteurized juices to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen’s name. In the 1970’s, Tim Hansen, the grandson of Hubert, developed and marketed a variety of Natural sodas and pasteurized shelf stable, 100% juices also under the Hansen’s label. Revolutionary at the time and still today, they have always been free of preservatives, caffeine, sodium, artificial flavors and colors. In 2008 we made a radical shift and said goodbye to high fructose corn syrup and hello to real cane sugar. More than 75 years and 30 real fruit and spice soda flavors later, our Natural and Diet Sodas have a nationwide following of loyal consumers. Real Flavor. Real Natural. That's how you make a real good soda.

        		From the Manufacturer
        	
        	
        		
        			BRAND STORY  The Walkers story begins over a hundred years ago in 1898 in the Scottish Highlands, when the twenty-one year old Joseph Walker opened the doors of his own bakery with a loan of £50 and the dream of making the finest shortbread in the world. In the first year of business, Joseph used every spare moment to perfect his shortbread recipe, and it was time well spent. As his fame spread, and demand increased for his quality shortbread, Joseph took the first steps to expanding the business by moving to a larger shop in the Speyside village of Aberlour and investing in a horse and cart to deliver his baking further afield. During the 30s, the business - like Joseph's family - was expanding. Two of his sons - James and Joseph - joined the business, bringing fresh, new ideas with them. By 1936, they had introduced three valuable additions to the business: a range of cakes, a selection of confectionery - and the company's first delivery van. Now Walkers produce could be sold even further afield, and the prospects for expansion were looking promising. While some manufacturers began to cut corners by using margarine instead of butter, Joseph believed that people still appreciated the care that went into making a superior product like Walkers shortbread. And he was right. That's why, even after Joseph Walker died in 1954, his sons continued to use his original recipe. Demand grew, and so did the business. By 1961, all three of James' children - Joseph, James and Marjorie - had joined the business, making the third generation of Walkers working for the family firm. By 1975, Walkers had outgrown their extended bakery, and moved to a custom built factory that gave them the extra space and facilities they needed to develop new products such as Chocolate Chip Shortbread and specialty cookies. By the 1970s, Joseph's grandchildren had begun exporting Walkers shortbread to over 60 countries around the world - still baking to his original recipe. Within a decade, they won the first of three Queen's Awards for Export Achievement - the highest accolade given to British exporters. Then, as now, Walkers stayed in touch with their customers by testing every new product in Aberlour's village shop. So, customers around the world are enjoying a range of products that were first given the seal of approval by the villagers of Aberlour. Consistent quality and traditionally delicious recipes have made Walkers the choice of the most discerning customers and retailers. Walkers reputation grows day by day as loyal customers worldwide delight in traditional shortbreads and innovative new products like almond, ginger and luxurious chocolate covered shortbread. All Walkers' products are packaged in its unmistakable red tartan and proudly bearing the image of Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora MacDonald, the image which captures one of the most romantic moments from Scotland’s history, and reflects all the tradition and care that goes into baking every piece of Walkers shortbread. The quality and natural goodness of Walkers has attracted many international awards, including five gold Mondiale medals and the Food from Britain Innovation Award. While Joseph's children and grandchildren have moved with the times, they have always remained true to his original ideal - and his original recipe. So, when the family opened a new factory at Elgin to produce their popular new range of shortbread cookies and biscuits, they naturally still insisted on using only the finest ingredients: plump fruits, aromatic spices, chunks of real chocolate and flavorsome nuts. And there's not an artificial flavoring, coloring or preservative in sight. Just as Joseph Walker guaranteed all those years ago. Today, Joseph would be proud to know that his great grandchildren are carrying on the family tradition and are now the fourth generation of Walkers to make 'The world's classic pure butter shortbread'.

                These not-to-be missed croissants were created by a local Frenchman who moved to the U.S. 25 years ago, and yearned for the authentic, buttery-rich croissants he grew up with back home. He hand-rolled his all-natural secret dough, rich in fresh farm butter, into jumbo-sized croissants, then flash-freezes them, unbaked. Ships frozen via 2-day Air Express in a Styrofoam cooler and dry ice on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

                In 1971, when Barbara started our company, the Bay Area was buzzing with young people full of a desire to express their love for all people. The world was changing daily as they created their own paths and sought to turn others onto new directions. Barbara, then 17, found her calling in real food and opened a small natural bakery in Northern California. She had a simple plan—make wholesome food taste incredibly delicious. Inspired by good health, family, and the kitchen table as the cornerstones of the good life, she used whole grains and oats just as nature intended—keeping things simple and real. The bakery exceeded her wildest dreams and grew from a storefront start-up to a thriving wholesale business. Since those first loaves more than 40 years ago, our product offerings have grown to include cereals, snack bars, cookies, and cheese puffs. We carry on Barbara’s commitment to create simple, wholesome, and delicious products with the most honest ingredients.
